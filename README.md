# TIROLEI — AI-Driven Metroidvania Prototype

Tirolei is an ongoing project that integrates art, artificial intelligence, and game development. The goal is to build a complete design and production ecosystem — from concept art and datasets to model training and deployment in Unity, while maintaining visual, technical, and narrative coherence.

## Roadmap (high level)
1. Dataset creation and curation
2. Metadata and data standardization
3. AI model experimentation for consistent art
4. Unity prototype core gameplay
5. Vertical slice merging art + gameplay + narrative
6. Playtesting and balancing

## Repository structure (simplified)
Tirolei/
 ├─ docs/               — planning, style guides and design docs
 ├─ data/               — datasets and metadata used for AI
 ├─ unity/              — Unity project for the playable prototype
 ├─ reports/            — research logs and experiments
 └─ README.md

## Documentation highlights
- Style guide: docs/guia_estilo_ia/
- Design + planning: docs/roadmap/
- Metadata standards: data/metadata/

## Naming conventions
- lowercase_with_underscores
- metadata in JSON only
- only validated content goes to /assets/approved

## Status
| Area | Progress |
|------|----------|
| Dataset structure | 70% |
| AI art consistency | ~60% |
| Unity prototype | early but functional |
| Documentation | expanding |

This is a student project with professional ambition: disciplined engineering + creative exploration.
